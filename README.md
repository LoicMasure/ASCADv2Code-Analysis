# Code Analysis of the ASCADv2 dataset for studying (Deep-Learning based) Side-Channel Attacks
## Author: Loïc Masure, Rémi Strullu
This repository contains the code analysis for the ANSSI implementation SecAESSTM32. It contains a notebook that can be ran based on some raw traces from the ASCADv2 dataset available at https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/ascadv2/. This will serve as a support for a future online presentation (released by the end of November 2020).

## Oral presentation
An [oral presentation](https://webmail.intra.cea.fr/owa/redir.aspx?C=BioB1j6TquGfv2LRbG4bhqzM9OTshBFor-231J8tw8ywtgEJk6bYCA..&URL=https%3a%2f%2fmediacenter3.univ-st-etienne.fr%2fvideos%2f%3fvideo%3dMEDIA201125165945975) has been given by Rémi Strullu at *Journée GDR Soc2 2020* held online in December 2020. Feedbacks are welcome !

## Similar works
A similar thorough study has been previously conducted by Olivier Bronchain and François-Xavier Standaert (UCL) at [CHES 2020](https://doi.org/10.13154/tches.v2020.i2.1-25). The authors emphasized the intrinsic difficulty of protecting software devices against worst-case attack scenarios, as such devices do not yield enough noise in the measurements to leverage the full power of the counter-measures. 
We based our attack on a slightly different path (more information to come in the next few days).
