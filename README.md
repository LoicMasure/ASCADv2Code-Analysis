# ASCADv2Code-Analysis
## Author: Loïc Masure (joint work with Rémi Strullu)
This repository contains the code analysis for the ANSSI implementation SecAESSTM32. It contains a notebook that can be ran based on some raw traces from the ASCADv2 dataset available at https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/ascadv2/. This will serve as a support for a future online presentation (released by the end of November 2020).

## Similar works
A similar thorough study has been previously conducted by Olivier Bronchain and François-Xavier Standaert (UCL) at [CHES 2020](https://doi.org/10.13154/tches.v2020.i2.1-25). The authors emphasized the intrinsic difficulty of protecting software devices against worst-case attack scenarios, as they do not yield enough noise in the measurements to leverage the full power of the masking and shuffling counter-measures. We based our attack on a slightly different path.
